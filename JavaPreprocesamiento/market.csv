,,If a financial institution commits an error either making the rollover distribution or receiving the rollover contribution a self-certification waiver is feasible.

,,In this case the uncashed check was strong evidence that the taxpayer was unaware that a rollover was needed. However an uncashed check by itself is not always granted a waiver. For example one taxpayer took money out of his IRA account to purchase an IRA annuity. After learning the fees associated with the product the taxpayer decided not to purchase the annuity and was sent a check from the company who had originally sold him his new IRA. The taxpayer then tried to rollover the amount into a new IRA a year later assuming the 60-day window would not apply because he never cashed the check.,,,,,

,,U.S. stocks on Tuesday finished in negative territory albeit off the worst levels of the session as worries about global economic growth and downbeat earnings outlooks from blue-chip companies sank equities following a rout in China's stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 125.98 points or 0.5% at 25191.43 but had been down by as many as 548 points at its low of the session. The S&P 500 index SPX -0.55% lost 0.6% at 2740.69 led by losses in energy stocks XLE -2.62%  and industrials. Meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP -0.42%  ended the day down 0.4% at 7437.54 but enjoyed a brief stint in positive territory in a frightful and volatile day for U.S. stocks. Notably in corporate news shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT -7.56% closed off 7.6% leading Dow decliners after the industrial giant reported profits and revenue ahead of analysts expectations but offered guidance that was below consensus. Another Dow component 3M Co.'s stock MMM -4.38% finished off 4.4% after issuing downbeat 2018 guidance. 3M and Caterpillar combined to account for nearly half the Dow's loss at Tuesday's open at one point during the session. On big bright spot shares of McDonald's Corp jumped 6.3% for its best day in about three years after its quarterly results on Tuesday. Markets headed lower out of the gate following the Shanghai Composite Index's SHCOMP -2.26% 2.3% loss giving back part of a two-day rally and reigniting fears of a slowdown in the second-largest economy which rippled through markets.

• It is important to understand the most important concept: Marijuana stocks move based on what happens at the margin. At the margin there are two kinds of players: smart money and momo.

,,Xi’s plan to build out China’s Silicon Valley will need more than infrastructure to succeed. Hong Kong and Macau are both former Western colonies promised a high-degree of autonomy until the middle of this century: They have their own legal and political systems and residents are afforded greater freedoms than their mainland counterparts. In Hong Kong especially concerns are rising that those rights are being eroded and that Beijing’s ultimate aim is to swallow up the city into the mainland.,,,,,

,,A self-certification waiver based on a misclassified account is most likely to be granted when there is evidence showing that you believed the account was qualified but in reality it was an unsuitable non-IRA account.

The SPDR Material Select Sector ETF XLB -0.99% was down as much as 3.1% at an intraday low of $51.03 which was 20.4% below the Jan. 26 record close of $64.09.
